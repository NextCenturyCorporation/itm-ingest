Here you will have the chance to review the decisions of other medical professionals in difficult triage scenarios to assess whether you would delegate a triage situation in the future to those decision makers.<br/><br/>In this phase, you will see scenarios where medics made decisions about whether to move to treat casualties or wait in their current location based on the tactical situation.<br/><br/>Each scenario is presented followed by how different medics carried out their assessment and decision-making for that situation. Their choices are listed showing what they decided to do in each probe scenario.<br/><br/>Each medic vignette is then followed by a few questions to assess how you perceived the medic's decision-making style.<br/><br/>While you work your way through each vignette imagine you have seen a lot of other observations of this medic, and the behavior you see here is typical for how they behave.<br/><br/>Please pay careful attention to what information is revealed to the decision maker, and consider their actions only with respect to the information they were given.<br/><br/>The survey should take about 20-30 minutes to complete. Thank you for your participation."
