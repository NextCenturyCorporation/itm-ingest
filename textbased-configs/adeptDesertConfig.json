According to the report, the US soldier started a fight with another US soldier, and the local soldier tried to de-escalate. They were both seriously injured because in the struggle, they fell against a wall of a damaged building, and the wall collapsed on them.\n\nThe helicopter has one slot for a serious injury. The hospital you will take the patient to is a military facility that serves both US and indigenous forces. The patient who isn’t transported by helicopter will have to go by slower ground vehicle which could potentially aggravate their injury and risk adverse medical consequences."
