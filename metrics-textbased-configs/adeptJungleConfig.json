You were told that a civilian found what looked like it might be an IED, reported it to authorities, and then against our advice, went back and apparently triggered accidental detonation while taking a closer look. There are two civilian patients, one closer to what looks like the IED materials and one further away on a path. The patient who is closer to the IED materials seems to be more seriously injured."
