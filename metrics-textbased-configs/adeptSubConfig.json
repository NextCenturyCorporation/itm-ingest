The Electrician Chief required one of the Electrician’s mates to work during their sleep cycle (coming off duty) to repair an electrical issue with the treadmill. A sailor who had been bugging the chief about getting it fixed for his own use was hanging around in his exercise clothes, waiting for it to be done. During the repair, there was a small electrical fire and both sailors (electrician’s mate and bystander) were seriously injured. They are reported to have similar injuries.\n\nCrew mates are bringing the patients to you in the wardroom. The corridor is tight and they can only bring one at a time."
