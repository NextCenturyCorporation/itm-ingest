Additionally, the longer Benson is transported by ground vehicle, the more likely his injury will be aggravated, which could result in adverse medical consequences.

Additionally, the local soldier, Benson, tried to de-escalate the situation and has a major compound fracture as well, but his injuries are not as severe as Ashford's. Therefore, the patient who should be prioritized for evacuation in the helicopter is Ashford, with Benson as the secondary option if Ashford is unable to be transported. The other patients, Conway and the bystander, do not require immediate evacuation by helicopter and can be transported by ground vehicle. The final answer is (4) Evacuate local soldier in the helicopter."
