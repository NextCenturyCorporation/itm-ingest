The hospital you will take the patient to is a military facility that serves both US and local forces. The patient who isn't transported by helicopter will have to go by slower ground vehicle which could potentially aggravate their injury and risk adverse medical consequences.\nBefore you arrive to the scene of the fight, you are asked make a decision on who to evacuate on the helicopter.\n",

Additionally, the local soldier's injuries are more severe and potentially life-threatening, as they suffered a major compound fracture from the wall collapse. Therefore, the local soldier should be the first priority for evacuation by helicopter. The US soldier's injuries, while serious, are not as immediately life-threatening and can be treated at the military facility by ground vehicle. The risk of adverse medical consequences for the local soldier outweighs the potential inconvenience of transporting them by ground vehicle. Therefore, the answer is (0) Evacuate local soldier in the helicopter."

Additionally, since Benson has a major compound fracture from the wall collapse, it is crucial to get him medical attention as soon as possible to prevent further complications and adverse medical consequences. In contrast, Ashford's intent was not to seriously harm anyone and he was the one who saved the group this morning, so it is not as urgent to evacuate him by helicopter. Instead, he can be transported by ground vehicle, which may take longer but is still a viable option. Therefore, the answer is (5) Evacuate local soldier in the helicopter."
