Burn dressing is essential in promoting wound healing, reducing the risk of infection, and alleviating pain. The severity of the burn and the potential for infection and scarring make it a critical priority to treat Alex first. Additionally, the fact that the burn is circumferential and covers a significant portion of Alex's body surface area increases the risk of hypovolemia, sepsis, and other systemic complications. Therefore, the answer is (0) Apply burn dressing."

Additionally, the fact that Alex's burn is circumferential and encompasses a large percentage of their body surface area further supports the need for immediate tagging.

However, the most pressing concern is the potential for respiratory compromise due to the rib fractures, which could lead to pneumonia or other life-threatening complications. Therefore, the best course of action is to perform a needle decompression to help clear the lung fields and improve breathing. This is a life-saving intervention that should take priority over all other options. The answer is (5) Perform a needle decompression."
