The first priority should be to control bleeding and increase blood volume. Therefore, the best course of action is to apply a tourniquet to Sam's affected limb. This will help to constrict blood flow to the affected area and prevent further blood loss. Once the tourniquet is applied, the next step would be to administer a blood transfusion to help replace lost blood and stabilize Sam's condition. Therefore, the answer is (1) Apply tourniquet."
