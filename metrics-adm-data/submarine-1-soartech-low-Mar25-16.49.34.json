The fact that both Alex and Sam have second and third degree burns on their forearms encompassing 9% of their body surface area is a critical factor, as these types of burns can lead to severe scarring, amputation, and even death if not properly treated. Therefore, the first priority is to treat Alex's injury, as he was the first to be injured and his burn is more extensive, covering 9% of his body surface area. The risk of delaying time-critical treatment to take vitals is not worth the potential consequences. Therefore, the answer is (3) Treat Alex's injury."

This is because both individuals have severe burns that require prompt treatment to prevent infection, reduce pain, and promote healing.

The fact that the submarine is on an intelligence gathering mission and must remain submerged at all costs does not change this priority. Therefore, the best course of action is to treat Charlie's injury first, as it is more severe and progressively worsening, and could potentially be life-threatening. Additionally, assessing Charlie's vital signs would not significantly delay treatment, as the submarine's medical supplies and equipment are likely already equipped with the necessary tools to treat such an injury. Therefore, the answer is (1) Treat Charlie's injury."

The other options, such as splinting the rib fractures or providing oral pain control, can be done after the chest tube has been inserted. Therefore, the answer is (2) Insert a chest tube."

Additionally, as Charlie's breathing is worsening, it is crucial to stabilize the pelvis (option (5)) to prevent further injury. Therefore, the answer is (3) Insert Nasopharyngeal Airway and (5) Stabilize the pelvis."
