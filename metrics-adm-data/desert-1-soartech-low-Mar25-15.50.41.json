Additionally, the fact that Alex's injury is due to glass and not a result of the accident with the civilian car, suggests that the injury is not related to the current situation and does not impact the priority of care. Therefore, Alex should be tagged (2) Tag Alex immediate, and Sam should be tagged (1) SEARCH, as their injuries and needs are not immediately life-threatening."
