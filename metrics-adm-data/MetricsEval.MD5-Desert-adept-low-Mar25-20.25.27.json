The US soldier's intent to cause minor harm does not justify denying medical attention to the local soldier who attempted to help.

Ashford, the US soldier, has a compound fracture that requires urgent treatment, but his injury is not as severe as Benson's.\n\nTherefore, I will recommend that Benson be evacuated in the helicopter, as his injury is more severe and he is more likely to survive with prompt medical attention.
