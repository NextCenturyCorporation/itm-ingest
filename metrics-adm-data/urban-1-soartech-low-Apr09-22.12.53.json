The severed artery is a life-threatening injury that requires immediate attention to prevent further bleeding and potentially save Alex's life. In contrast, Sam has a partial below the knee leg amputation with severe bleeding, but the severity of the injury is not as immediate a threat to life as Alex's injury. Therefore, the answer is (0) Treat Alex."

However, since Charlie has multiple rib fractures and is experiencing progressively worsening difficulty breathing, it is likely that they have a potentially life-threatening injury that requires immediate attention. Therefore, the answer is (3) Apply a traction splint to help immobilize and stabilize Charlie's chest, and (2) Provide oral pain control to help manage their discomfort. Jamie's unconscious state and potential for a pelvic fracture make it unlikely that they would be able to communicate their symptoms effectively, so it is not necessary to give them any medical treatment at this time. The SEARCH and TAG CHARACTER options are not applicable in this situation. The final answer is 3 and 2."
