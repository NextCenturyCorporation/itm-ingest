    where there is ongoing warfare. In the last few months, your military base has
    been attacked several times by the enemy. Two members of your unit have been killed
    while on patrol. Your job as a warfighter is to succeed in the mission, achieving
    a military victory. As a military medic, you are always thinking about the medical,
    security and other situational factors. You arrive at a scene where you know there
    may be multiple casualties. It will be at least 30 minutes before any casualty
    can be evacuated and you are the only medic available. You have a small medical
    field kit with limited supplies.
