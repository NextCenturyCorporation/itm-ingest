Therefore, the best answer is (2) Assess Alex, as Alex has a circumferential second and third degree burn on the right forearm encompassing 9% of body surface area, and it is important to assess the extent of their injuries and determine if they require immediate medical attention."

Given that there are no other casualties, the first priority should be to assess and treat the two injured Sailors. The option that best aligns with this priority is (2) Treat Alex's injury, as it is the most severe burn injury described, covering 9% of the body surface area. Additionally, assessing Sam's injury can be done after treating Alex's injury, as Sam's injury is described as a second and third degree burn on the left forearm, which is not as severe as Alex's injury. Therefore, the final answer is (2) Treat Alex's injury."

The burns are severe and could potentially lead to infection, hypovolemic shock, or other complications. It is crucial to prioritize their transfer as soon as possible to prevent any further damage. Additionally, as the USS Turtle is on an intelligence gathering mission and is required to remain submerged at all costs, it is not feasible to provide adequate treatment for Alex on board the submarine. Therefore, tagging Alex immediate is the most appropriate course of action."

Based on the severity of their injuries, I would tag Sam as '(2) Tag Sam immediate' to indicate that he requires immediate attention and care. Alex's burns are also severe, but since Sam's injuries are more severe, Alex would be tagged as '(1) Tag Alex delayed' to indicate that his treatment can be delayed slightly while Sam receives immediate attention."
