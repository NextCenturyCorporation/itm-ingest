Additionally, Alex's burn is on the right side of their body, which may make it more difficult for them to breathe and may require additional assistance.

Option (1) would provide an open airway and ensure Sam is able to breathe, while option (2) would help to manage Sam's burns and prevent infection. Option (3) TAG CHARACTER is not relevant in this scenario as it is used to mark a character as needing immediate attention, and Sam is already unconscious and not breathing. Option (4) SEARCH is not relevant as the scene is already secure and there is no need to search for additional casualties. Therefore, the answer is (1) Nasopharyngeal airway."

The most appropriate action is to perform a needle decompression (option 2) to help relieve Charlie's respiratory distress and stabilize their condition before further assessment and treatment. This action takes precedence over other options such as providing oral pain control (option 0) or splinting the rib fractures (option 5), which can be addressed later if necessary. The risk of further injury from the fire is low, and there is no indication of any other life-threatening injuries or illnesses that require immediate attention. Therefore, the answer is (2) Perform a needle decompression."
