Adiwijaya demonstrated moral merit by finding and reporting the potential IED, which likely saved lives and prevented further harm. In contrast, Bun did not have any intent and was merely nearby, indicating a lower moral deservingness. Adiwijaya's proximity to the IED materials and potential exposure to harm further support prioritizing their treatment. By treating Adiwijaya first, we can ensure that they receive the necessary medical attention and potentially prevent further harm or loss of life.  Therefore, the answer is (3) Treat Adiwijaya."

In contrast, Bun, who had no intent and was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time, deserves medical attention regardless of his location. The principle of rescue prioritization based on moral deservingness dictates that Bun should be evacuated first, using the limited helicopter transport spot."
