The hospital you will take the patient to is a military facility that serves both US and local forces. The patient who isn't transported by helicopter will have to go by slower ground vehicle which could potentially aggravate their injury and risk adverse medical consequences.

The injured local soldier just saved the whole group this morning by noticing an ambush setup.\"\nThe bystander also states, \"Sometimes I'm not even sure who our enemies and allies are around here.

Additionally, the local soldier's injury may be more severe and potentially life-threatening due to the compound fracture from the wall collapse, whereas the US soldier's injury is a major compound fracture but may be more stable due to the military uniform providing some protection.
